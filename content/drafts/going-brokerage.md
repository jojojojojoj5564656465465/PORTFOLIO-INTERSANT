Where should you park your hard earned money?

<!-- end -->

### Where does this rule come from?

It comes from a research paper in 1998 called [review](/reviews/brokerages).

The researchers divided past financial data into rolling 30 year periods (from 1926-1995), then tested how likely the portfolio was to survive for the whole 30 years at various asset allocations and various withdrawal rates.

Back in the 90s, there was a prevalent idea in the financial planning community that if the stock market returned 7-12% a year, you could spend 7-12% of your portfolio every year in retirement and expect it to last. This important study threw a lot of cold water on that idea. It turned out if you were spending more than 5% of your portfolio a year (again, adjusted to inflation), you would be very lucky if your portfolio lasted 30 years. Let"s look at the data from the study. This is the most important table from the paper:

_Editor"s note: One of my pet peeves are journals that include tabular and text data as images, thus rendering the data almost useless for anyone who wants to copy it and use it themselves. Journal papers are data graveyards. This is why I copied out the table by hand and put it into a HTML table so anyone can easily copy it._
