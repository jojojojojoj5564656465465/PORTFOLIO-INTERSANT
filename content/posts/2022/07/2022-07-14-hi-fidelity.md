[Fidelity is a great one-stop-shop for all your banking and investing needs.

<!-- end -->

Fidelity is a full service, low cost brokerage offering a full range of investment and bank like services. I currently use them as my primary bank. Maybe you should too after reading this.

# Investing

Fidelity was the first major brokerage to switch to fractional share trading on basically all stocks and ETFs. This is great because you can buy shares in dollar amounts instead of waiting until you have enough to buy single shares.

Fractional shares also mean you can ditch mutual funds and replace them with ETFs, but maintain the best of both. ETFs are usually tax efficient and portable between brokerages and since you can buy in dollar amounts you have essentially the same features of a mutual fund, which the added advantage of being able to trade them whenever you like instead of the end of the day.

# Banking

Fidelity offers a Cash Management account that comes with a debit card and is functionally equialent to a checking account.

I'm surprised more people don't use it and instead stick with tranditional banks like Chase or Bank of America.

It offers amongst other things:

* Free debit card
* Free ATM withdrawls worldwide from any ATM so you don't have to worry about going out of network
* Transfers between banks often occur same day. Much faster than the 3 or 4 day window at most banks.
* Early deposit of direct deposits. Get your paycheck a day or 2 early.

I've been a Fidelity convert for several years. It surprises me more people aren't and i
