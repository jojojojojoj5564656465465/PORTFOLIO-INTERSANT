Hello, I am the The Polite Investor, a polite Englishman that has been
living in the US for 10 years.

Although I have always been interested
in personal finance and investing, once my employer enrolled me in
their retirement plan, I thought it was time to
get serious and figure out how the American financial system works to
make sound investment choices. 

I started this site to document my financial
journey and offer my opinions to help others. Perhaps you might learn something from
my experiences and together we can all try to lead better financial
lives.

I believe the key to building wealth is disiplined saving
and investing coupled with a somewhat minimalist lifestyle. You don't
need stuff and you should have a healthy skepticism towards activities
your peers engage in: mortgages, expensive cars, expensive vacations.
You'll find a little bit of my personal philosophy peppered throughout
the site.



I hope you feel welcome here. Take what you find useful and leave the
rest. Pass on what youâ€™ve learned to your friends. May you find the
financial success you deserve.
