## Are Credit Freezes Free?

Yes, you should not have to pay to freeze and unfreeze your credit. Some bureaus offer similar services and monitoring tools that do
cost money, but you don't need to buy these.

## How Long Does It Take For A Credit Freeze To Activate?

If you freeze your credit online, bureaus are required to activate the freeze within one business day. In practice it is generally instantaneous so you can lock and unlock your credit files as needed.

If requested by phone, it must be done within three business days, according to the FTC. Likewise, applying by mail will take longer. I recommend always using the online method.

# Does Freezing Hurt My Credit Score?

No, it simply stops hard pulls on your account so you cannot open new credit lines. It's perfectly safe.

# Can I Apply For Loans And Credit Cards?

No, you must unfreeze your credit before applying for a new credit line, but it's easy to freeze and temporarily unfreeze your card when you need to.
