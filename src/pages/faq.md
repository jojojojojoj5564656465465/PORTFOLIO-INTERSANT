## Personal Finance

### How much should I save?

Try to aim for saving 20% of your gross income for retirement. Saving
for other goals (house down payment, new car, college, paying off
student loans etc) is all in addition to that. If you are not saving
that much, try to increase how much you save by 1% each year and as
you accomplish your other financial goals, redirect that income toward
retirement savings.
